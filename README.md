### Description: 
- Similar to how the pokedex pulled up information about your search/parameter, I will be creating a weather app that someone could use at the start of the day.

### How to Get Started: 
- Wireframe my "end product/goal" AKA how things should be laid out and what information it should contain
- Brainstorm and list what tools/skills/functions/methods I think I need to actualize this
- Trello my initial timeline, breaking down every single task I can think of. From start to finish. Explicitly budgeting in buffer time for office hours, mishaps, etc. 

### If time allows, extensions: 
- 7 Day Forecast
- Hourly Forecast
- Different Types of Data
- Graphing Data
- Local Data Storage

### Credits: 
Break down sources based on category, for example: 
- HTML Sites Used
- CSS Sites Used
- Javascript Sites Used
